# Agile Project Document

## Project Title: Smart Traffic Violation Pattern Detector

## 1. Project Overview

The Smart Traffic Violation Pattern Detector analyzes traffic violation
data using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and
Seaborn. The objective is to identify trends, hotspots, driver behavior,
and weather impacts to improve traffic safety.

## 2. Project Vision Statement

To build a data-driven analytical solution that identifies traffic
violation patterns and empowers authorities to improve road safety and
traffic management.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

### Primary Objectives

-   Identify peak violation times.
-   Detect high-risk locations.
-   Analyze driver behavior.
-   Understand weather-based impact.

### Secondary Objectives

-   Clean and preprocess traffic data.
-   Generate visual insights.
-   Produce automated summary reports.
